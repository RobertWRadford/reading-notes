# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

"HTML describes the structure of pages"
f.e.
```
<html>
   <body>
     <h1> this is the main heading </h1>
     <p>This is a paragraph. It may be an introduction or some such thing.</p>
     <h2>This is a sub-heading and will be smaller in size</h2>
  </body>
</html>
```

The html and body brackets act like containers defining everything between them as their descriptor, much like { } encloses a function in programming.

You can add attributes to a tag line 
f.e. 
```
<p lang="en-us"> english text </p>
```

A better structured page would include a 
```
<head> 
  <title> this is the title </title>
</head>
```
